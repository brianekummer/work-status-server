# This matrix defines the conditions for each status to display as well as what to display for that status.
#   - These entries are evaluated in order, so the order is important. For example, if my home status is :8bit: then I'm playing even if my work status is PTO
#   - If a condition
#      - Is null or an empty string, then it matches everything
#      - Is *, then it matches only non-empty values
#   - Slack automatically sets users away after some amount of inactivity although I've seen differing statements of how long that is.

# The following line defines how this file is parsed
