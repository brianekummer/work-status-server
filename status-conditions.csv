# This matrix defines the conditions for each status to display as well as what to display for that status.
#   - These entries are evaluated in order so the order is important. For example, if my home status is :8bit: then I'm playing even if my work status is PTO
#   - If a condition is null or an empty string then it is ignored.
#   - Slack automatically sets users away after some amount of inactivity although I've seen differing statements of how long that is.
